    <h2 class="episode-title">Episode 006: Is Insurance Analytics an IT Function?</h2>
    <p class="episode-description">In this episode, hosts Samir and Sudhar delve into the increasingly crucial analytics
      in insurance, especially for mid-size insurers poised for growth. Analytics, traditionally a cornerstone of
      insurance for tasks like determining premiums and assessing risks, has now permeated nearly every facet of the
      industry. From personalizing customer experiences to detecting fraud and developing innovative insurance products,
      the applications of analytics are vast and varied.</p>
    <p>
      As the importance of analytics skyrockets, insurers face the critical decision of how best to integrate this
      function into their operations. We explore four common models: centralizing the function within IT, centralizing
      it outside of IT, distributing it across business units, and hybrid approaches. The choice among these models
      hinges on several factors, including the company's view of analytics as either a foundational skill for all or a
      specialized skill for a few, the role of data management in operations, the company's size, and the specific
      purposes of analysis, whether for business reporting or operational execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the episode discusses how the extent of AI adoption influences the organizational placement of
      analytics, highlighting a spectrum from basic use of commercial tools enhancing foundational skills across the
      workforce to the development of custom AI models necessitating specialized expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      With no one-size-fits-all solution, the episode underscores the importance of insurers considering their unique
      context and needs when deciding on an analytics integration model. Regular reevaluation is key as circumstances
      evolve. Above all, the focus should remain on building an effective analytics capability, regardless of its
      organizational home, to drive innovation and growth in the competitive insurance landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tune in to navigate the complexities of integrating analytics in the insurance industry and to learn how
      technology leaders can harness its power to propel their companies forward!</p>

    <h2 class="episode-title">Episode 005: The Innovation Imperative - Honor the Past, Embrace the Future</h2>
    <p class="episode-description">The insurance industry, with its focus on risk management and complex legacy systems,
      faces inherent challenges when it comes to innovation. However, in today's competitive landscape, innovation is an
      imperative for growth and profitability.</p>
    <p>
      This podcast dialogue offers important perspectives on how insurance companies can overcome internal tensions and
      foster a culture of innovation, drawing on the industry's strength in managing risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key insight is that while insurance involves minimizing risk, innovation requires taking risks. Yet insurance
      expertise lies in controlling risk, not avoiding it altogether. Thus innovation should be seen as "controlled
      chaos"â€”applying risk management principles to new ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another central theme is the constant pull between incremental and disruptive innovation. Speakers noted large
      insurers tend to favor smaller innovations that build on the existing business. But the option exists to purse
      radical ideas that challenge the status quo.
    </p>
    <p>
      When organizing innovation, a key question arises - should IT own it or have a dedicated team? The answer likely
      depends on the type of innovations sought. IT implements proven solutions, while a strategy/innovation group
      scouts for disruptive concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of innovations, the rapid growth of biometric data and advances in climate modeling are cited as
      potential big "I" innovations that could transform insurance fundamentals. On the smaller "i" end, cyber risk
      insurance is gaining traction as modeling and data improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adoption remains slow though, as new tech is held to high standards to disrupt ingrained practices. But with
      ratings agencies scoring innovation, insurers are recognizing the need for strategic capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, innovation in insurance requires carefully balancing risk-taking with risk management, incremental
      steps with big ideas. While held back by legacy systems, regulatory caution and high adoption barriers, insurers
      can foster methodical innovation by leveraging their strengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an established industry, insurance may not attract the most cutting-edge talent. But thoughtful leadership,
      governance and collaboration with insurtechs can develop an innovation culture poised for the digital future.
    </p>
    <p>
      This podcast offers valuable insights for insurance executives on moving past inherent tensions, organizing
      innovation teams, pursuing incremental or disruptive ideas, and building strategic capabilities. With the right
      focus and risk balance, insurers can overcome inertia and reinvent traditional products to drive the next era of
      growth.

    <h2 class="episode-title">Episode 004: Insurance Tech News Roundup, December 2023 Edition</h2>
    <p class="episode-description">In this 4th episode of the PremiumBytes video podcast, hosts Sudhar and Samir discuss
      the time of the year (year end holidays) being a time when most media is making predictions for 2024 insurance
      tech trends, so the hosts agreed that making predictions isnâ€™t worth anyoneâ€™s time, so took a different route and
      discussed and reacted to recent notable news articles related to insurance technology.</p>
    <p>
      A major news item was Ebix filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and reaching a "stalking horse" agreement
      to sell their life insurance and annuity software assets to Zinnia. This will have ripple effects across many life
      insurance carriers. Another discussion centered around whether it's worthwhile to measure developer productivity -
      the hosts felt focusing on business value delivered is more important than metrics like lines of code. The idea of
      "open insurance" was touched on but seen as potentially challenging to implement in North America versus other
      regions, at least currently. Data and AI continue to be key themes, with LexisNexis providing data to "feed hungry
      AI" at life insurers and startups like Assured Allies using data to predict risk events. There is an ongoing shift
      for carriers from financing losses to preventing them, using data and technology.
      Overall the episode aimed to highlight timely articles vs making broad predictions, with the hosts wishing
      everyone a happy holiday season and successful 2024.</p>

    <h2 class="episode-title">Episode 003: The inherent tensions between architecture and agile</h2>
    <p class="episode-description">In this 3rd episode of the PremiumBytes video podcast, hosts Sudhar and Samir discuss
      how agile and architecture approaches can coexist within insurance organizations despite inherent tensions between
      them. They start with grounding the terms "architecture" and "agile", noting that adaptability in a changing
      context is a common foundational motivation for both.</p>
    <p>They identify several of the sources of inherent tensions that predictably crop up, such taking the time to
      deliberately define the architecture being viewed as getting in the way of expeditiously writing code. The hosts
      provide a reframing that it behooves engineers to be intentional about what characteristics the system they
      develop exhibits, because they will get some set of characteristics, and odds for all characteristics being
      desirable are unfavorable.</p>
    <p>
      They also discuss how iterative development is sometimes viewed through the frame of not having done things right
      the first time. They compare writing software to writing in a natural language such as English, pointing out that
      natural language writing is very much iterative in that people take the time to prepare an initial draft and
      successively revise it until they have a high quality version. Having a perfectly written final version the first
      time is never an expectation in writing in a natural language, so should it not be an expectation when writing in
      a programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion ends with the hosts offering insurance technology leaders 3 practical tips for resolving some of
      the tensions: hold delivery teams accountable for making sound architecture, planning for iterative development,
      and preferring architecture guidelines over hard and fast standards.

    <p class="episode-description">Attempting to replace aging core insurance systems leads to multi-year, high-risk
      projects, a daunting prospect. Yet standing still means falling further behind an industry constantly in flux.
      What's an insurance technology
      leader to do? Incremental, agile approaches emerge as lower risk paths. Success requires aligning business, IT and
      partners on a unified vision. Not just shiny new technology, but delivering business capabilities. Hybrid teams
      allow knowledge transfer and manage risk. Savvy CIOs revitalize rather than scrap what exists. Hosts Samir and
      Sudhar draw on real-world examples balancing pragmatism with ambition.</p>
