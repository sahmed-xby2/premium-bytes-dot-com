        <h1>BrokerTech Landscape Report</h1>
        <h2>December 2025</h2>
        <div style="clear: left">
            <p>Over the past several years, the broker technology (“BrokerTech”) landscape has evolved rapidly, yet
                unevenly. New platforms, tools, and operating models continue to emerge across distribution, while
                carriers and brokers alike struggle to maintain a shared understanding of where innovation is truly
                occurring, which capabilities matter most, and how the ecosystem fits together.</p>

            <p>We created this report to address that gap.</p>

            <p>
                BrokerTech is frequently discussed in fragments: quoting here, agency management systems there, AI
                everywhere. What’s often missing is a concise, decision-oriented view of the full landscape; one that
                helps technology leaders understand <span class="bold">how these capabilities fit
                    together, why they matter, and where to focus attention.</span> This report is intended to serve as
                a practical reference point for those
                conversations.</p>

            <p>
                We are uniquely positioned to produce this perspective. As long-time insurance technology practitioners
                and consultants, we work alongside carrier and broker technology leaders every day, navigating legacy
                constraints, modernization pressures, and the realities of execution. Through the PremiumBytes podcast,
                we regularly engage with CIOs, CTOs, founders, and operators across the insurance ecosystem, including
                many directly shaping the BrokerTech market.</p>

            <p>
                The timing matters. Interest and investment in BrokerTech has accelerated materially, driven by
                consolidation among brokers, rising expectations for digital distribution, AI-enabled workflows, and
                increased pressure on carriers to integrate more seamlessly with their distribution partners. Events
                such as InsureTech Connect highlighted not only the growth of BrokerTech vendors, but also the growing
                strategic importance of brokers as technology-enabled platforms rather than purely intermediaries.</p>

            <p>
                This report was developed through a combination of direct industry observation, structured research, and
                iterative analysis. We leveraged publicly available sources, BrokerTech community forums, insights from
                InsureTech Connect, and our own domain expertise. While AI tools were used to accelerate research and
                synthesis, the structure, categorization, and conclusions reflect our judgment and experience.</p>

            <p>
                This is not an exhaustive catalog, nor an endorsement of any vendor. Instead, it is a <span
                    class="bold;">snapshot of how the BrokerTech landscape is taking shape, and how technology leaders
                    should think about it
                    today.</span></p>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Read This Report</h2>
        <p>This report is designed to be <span class="bold">exploratory and decision-oriented</span>, not definitive.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Categories represent capability clusters</span>, not rigid product silos. Many
                vendors operate across multiple categories.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Inclusion does not imply endorsement</span>, and absence does not imply irrelevance.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">“Established”</span> and <span class="bold">“Emerging”</span> reflect market maturity
                and visibility, not company quality or long-term viability.</li>
            <li>Examples are provided to illustrate the landscape, not to catalog every participant.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We encourage readers to use this report as a <span class="bold">conversation starter</span>, to frame
            strategy discussions, validate assumptions, and identify areas that warrant deeper exploration.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h1>BrokerTech Capability Landscape: Value-Chain View</h1>
    <p>The following tables organize BrokerTech solutions by <span class="bold">where they operate along the insurance
            distribution value
            chain</span>, rather than by vendor type or technology stack.</p>

    <p>We chose this lens intentionally. Brokers and carriers rarely adopt technology in isolation; they invest in
        <span class="bold">capabilities that support specific moments in the distribution lifecycle</span>, from
        acquisition and quoting, through
        servicing, compliance, and claims. Viewing BrokerTech through this lens highlights where innovation is
        concentrated, where legacy systems continue to dominate, and where integration pressure is highest.
    </p>

    <p>Each category is evaluated from two perspectives:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Relevance for Broker Technology Executives</span>, who must balance scale, efficiency,
            and differentiation across
            multiple carrier relationships.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Implications for Carrier Technology Executives</span>, who increasingly need to integrate
            with broker-owned
            platforms rather than control the end-to-end experience.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The intent is not to rank categories, but to <span class="bold">clarify why each capability matters and how power
            dynamics are shifting</span>
        across distribution.</p>

    <h2>What the Capability View Reveals</h2>
    <p>Several patterns emerge from this capability-based view of the BrokerTech landscape.</p>

    <p>First, <span class="bold">the center of gravity is moving upstream</span>. Marketplaces, aggregators, and
        advanced quoting tools are no longer just lead-generation mechanisms, they increasingly encode underwriting
        appetite, rules, and intelligence
        directly into broker workflows. This gives brokers greater leverage while raising the bar for carrier
        integration.</p>

    <p>Second, categories are <span class="bold">blurring rather than converging</span>. Many vendors span multiple
        capabilities: quoting blends
        into marketplaces; CRM overlaps with analytics; AI cuts across everything. This suggests future differentiation
        will come less from standalone tools and more from orchestration and ecosystem design.</p>

    <p>Third, AI and automation appear today as a discrete category largely because of timing. Over the longer term,
        these capabilities are likely to become embedded expectations rather than standalone solutions, similar to how
        APIs and cloud infrastructure quietly became table stakes.</p>

    <p>Finally, several “traditional” categories - such as onboarding, compliance, and claims - remain ripe for innovation,
        not because the processes are new, but because the experience and speed still lag business expectations.</p>

    <hr>
    <h1>BrokerTech Through an Industry-Segment Lens</h1>
    <p>While capability categories explain <span class="italicize">what</span> BrokerTech solutions do, industry
        segments explain <span class="italicize">why they differ</span>.</p>

    <p>Life and annuity, personal lines, commercial P&C, and group benefits each bring distinct product complexity,
        regulatory requirements, sales cycles, and data needs. As a result, many BrokerTech vendors intentionally focus
        on a single segment rather than attempting to serve the entire market.</p>

    <p>This segment-based view highlights <span class="bold">how the same BrokerTech capability can manifest very
            differently</span> depending on
        context, and why technology leaders should resist assuming that success in one segment translates cleanly to
        another.</p>

    <h2>Segment Nuances Matter More Than They Appear</h2>

    <p>Segment specialization is not accidental. It is structural.</p>

    <p>High-volume, short-cycle segments such as personal lines naturally attract dense innovation and competition,
        while data-heavy, longer-cycle segments like commercial P&C reward depth and specialization. Group benefits
        continues to blur insurance and HR technology, while life and annuity innovation tends to move in waves aligned
        with product and regulatory change.</p>

    <p>Over time, the density of BrokerTech innovation is likely to mirror not just premium volume, but <span
            class="bold">where brokers
            and carriers are most willing to operationalize new models</span>. Tracking these shifts longitudinally may
        prove as
        valuable as any single snapshot.</p>

    <h2>Closing Thoughts and What Comes Next</h2>
    <p>This report is intended to be useful, not final.</p>

    <p>The BrokerTech landscape is evolving quickly, and no static view can fully capture its trajectory. Our goal is to
        provide a clear, grounded snapshot that helps technology leaders orient themselves, ask better questions, and
        engage more productively with partners across the ecosystem.</p>

    <p>We welcome feedback, especially where you believe categories are missing, players are misclassified, or emerging
        capabilities deserve deeper attention. If you are a broker, carrier, or technology provider operating in this
        space, we invite you to share your perspective.</p>

    <p>We expect to revisit and refine this landscape over time, whether through periodic updates or deeper dives into
        specific segments or capability areas. Longitudinal views often reveal more than any single point-in-time
        analysis.</p>

    <p>If this report helps inform your internal discussions or external partnerships, we encourage you to share it. And
        if there are areas you believe merit deeper exploration, let us know - we’re listening!</p>
